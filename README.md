# Bad Dad Jokes 
In the mood for a few good "Dad" jokes? 

This Bad Dad Jokes app involved using a third-party API to fetch and display jokes, changing with a button click.

## Objective
* Use the fetch method to retrieve data from the icanhazdadjoke.com API, with async-await promises or the .then() method.
* Create a click event so the joke will change when the button is clicked.
